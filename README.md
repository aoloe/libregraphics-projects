- Each directory contains one project:
  - `project/project.yaml` is a description with specific fields
  - `project/project.md` is a freeform description.
  - `project/project.png` is the bitmap logo.
  - `project/project.svg` is the svg logo.

## Todo:

- patch the markdown library to set the initial level of headings
