# Ghostscript

Ghostscript provides an interpreter for the PostScript language and for the Portable Document Format (PDF) files, with the ability to convert between them but also to many raster formats, view them on displays, and print them on printers that don't have PostScript language capability built in.

The Ghostscript library implements the graphics and filtering (data compression / decompression / conversion) capabilities that appear as primitive operations in the PostScript language and in PDF.
