# G'MIC, GREYC's Magic Image Converter

G'MIC
- Defines a minimal but powerful script language (G'MIC) dedicated to the design of image processing pipelines.
- Provides an interpreter of this language (in C++), distributed as an open-source module/library embeddable in third-party applications.
- Proposes two binary tools one to be run from a shell and the other as an interactive plug-in for GIMP.

G'MIC is focused on the design of complex pipelines for converting, manipulating, filtering and visualizing generic 1d/2d/3d multi-spectral image datasets. Of course, it is able to manage color images, but also more complex data as image sequences or 3d volumetric datasets.
