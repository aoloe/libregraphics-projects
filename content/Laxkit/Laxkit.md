# Laxkit

The Laxkit is a semi-permeable C++ Xlib wrapper. If you are looking for a window toolkit for X that is rough, highly experimental, and whose API is quite unstable, this is the toolkit for you. It is being made with an eye toward being able to easily make programs and utilities that are useful to artists.
