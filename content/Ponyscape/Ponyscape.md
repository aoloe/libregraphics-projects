# Ponyscape

Ponyscape is a derivative of Inkscape:
- Providing vector art software that is easy and entertaining to use
- Creating vector art software which contains cutting edge features
- Creating software which is relatively stable so it can be used both professionally and by hobbyists
- Adhere as close as possible to the SVG 1.1 standard, but don't let this get in the way of the previously listed goals
