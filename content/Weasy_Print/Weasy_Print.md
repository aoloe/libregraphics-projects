# Weasy Print

WeasyPrint is a visual rendering engine for HTML and CSS that can export to
PDF. It aims to support web standards for printing.

It is based on various libraries but not on a full rendering engine like WebKit or Gecko. The CSS layout engine is written in Python, designed for pagination, and meant to be easy to hack on.
