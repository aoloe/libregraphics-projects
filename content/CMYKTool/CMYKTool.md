# CMYKTool

With CMYKTool you can convert images between ICC profiles (RGB, CMYK) while preserving pure black, preserve pure grey, or attempt to underfill black to give a fake "overprint" effect.

Images and their individual channels can be inspected, and a soft proof mode shows images would look when printed.

Saves JPEG, TIFF (8- and 16-bit) with or without embedded profiles.
