# Entangle

Entangle provides a graphical interface for "tethered shooting", aka taking photographs with a digital camera completely controlled from the computer.

Entangle is built on top of libgphoto using GTK-3 for its interface. It is fully colour managed, auto-detecting system monitor profile and applying the neccessary transforms when displaying images
